ELXIS PUBLIC LICENSE (EPL) 
Version 1.1 - September 02, 2012
================================

Copyright (C) 2012 Ioannis Sannos - Elxis Team ( http://www.elxis.org/ ).
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.


== Preamble ==

The Elxis Public License (EPL) is a free license for software and other kinds of 
works although it was initially written for Elxis CMS. The scope of this license 
is to make sure Elxis will always be an open source software released for free to 
the public in its original form. In order to protect Elxis from license violations 
from which, unfortunately, we have suffered in the past, EPL prohibits you from 
renaming Elxis, removing copyright notes and share modified copies of it. The terms 
and conditions described in this document, besides Elxis, applies to any software 
released under the EPL license.


== Definitions ==

    * "This License" refers to version 1.1 of the Elxis Public License (EPL).
    * "Program" or "Software" refers to any copyrightable work licensed 
        under this License.
    * To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in 
    a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact 
        copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work 
        or a work "based on" the earlier work.
    * A "fork" is a modified and/or renamed copy of the original software distributed 
        and developed by other than the original author. EPL does not allow forks.
    * "CMS" Content Management System
    * "Elxis CMS" or just "Elxis": Elxis content management system of version 4.0 or newer.
    * EPL: Elxis Public License (this license).
    * Elxis Team: Elxis development team, which has leader and legal representative 
        Ioannis Sannos.
    * Extensions: Software packages that can be installed from Elxis administration 
        console and extend Elxis features (modules, components, templates, plugins, 
        search engines, authentication methods or other).

    * Develop, publish and sell extensions for the Software. These extensions can 
        be either free or commercial (see note 1), and should be installed after

        Software package even if they are free (you are not allowed to re-pack or

There is no warrant for the Software, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties 
provide the Software "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, 
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness 
for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the 
Software is with you. Should the Software prove defective, you assume the cost of 
all necessary servicing, repair and correction on your web site.


(D) Limitation of Liability

holder bye liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or 
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Software (including 
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained 
by you or third parties or a failure of the Software to operate with any other programs), 
even if such holder has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


(E) Notes

    (1) The third party extensions can be of a different license than EPL.
    (2) In case of Elxis CMS the original author is Elxis Team and the distribution 
        source of the Software is the elxis.org web site (http://www.elxis.org) 
        or other web site managed by Elxis Team.
    (3) Modifications are allowed in the source code for private use only (your web 
        site). In any case you can't rename the Software, re-brand it, or change the 
        original copyright notes. You are not allowed to re-pack a modified version 
        of the Software, re-distribute it, or use it in another web site.
    (4) Elxis copyright holder is Ioannis Sannos, legal representative of Elxis Team.
    (5) Improvements, fixes and new ideas should be sent to the original author of the 
        Software for inclusion in the official release.

        are not responsible for any damages that may occur to your web site such as 
        data or money loss by the use of the Software.
    (7) Any rights not stated in this license are prohibited. In case you have 
        questions or you need a special permission, we encourage you to ask written 
        permission by the Software author (Ioannis Sannos / Elxis Team in case of 
        Elxis CMS). 


== Apply EPL to your own Software ==

If you have developed a program and you want to release it under the Elxis Public 
License attach the following notices to the start of each source file of your program.

    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
    Copyright: (C) {year}  {name of author} {author's URL (if any)}
    License: Elxis Public License ( http://www.elxis.org/elxis-public-license.html )
    {Program name} is free software. Read the license for details.

You may also include a full copy of EPL into your software package.
